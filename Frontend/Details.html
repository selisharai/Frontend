                <p>As of my last update in September 2021, Patanjali is an Indian consumer goods company founded by Baba Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna. It is known for producing a wide range of products, including herbal and natural healthcare, personal care, and food products. One of their popular product categories is herbal soaps.
                    Patanjali herbal soaps claim to use natural ingredients and traditional Ayurvedic formulations. They are often marketed as being free from harmful chemicals and synthetic additives. Some of the common variants of Patanjali soaps include neem soap, aloe vera soap, lemon soap, turmeric soap, and many more.
                    Please note that product availability and offerings may have changed since my last update. For the most current information about Patanjali soaps or any other products they offer, I recommend visiting their official website or checking with authorized retail outlets.</p>
